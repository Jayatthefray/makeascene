## Smart Storyboarding System (Core Innovation)

### Constraint Logic Engine

The heart of Make A Scene is its intelligent constraint system that ensures every generated scene is physically filmable with the user's available resources.

#### Equipment Detection
```javascript
const EquipmentProfile = {
  actors: number,           // 1-8 available performers
  hasTripod: boolean,       // Stabilization equipment
  hasSecondCamera: boolean, // Multiple angle capability
  hasLighting: boolean,     // Controlled lighting setup
  hasProps: boolean,        // Available scene props
  location: string          // Indoor, outdoor, specific room
};
```

#### Shot Feasibility Matrix
```javascript
const SHOT_FEASIBILITY = {
  'Selfie': {
    tripodRequired: false,
    minActors: 1,
    maxActors: 2,
    cameraOperator: 'actor',
    complexity: 'low',
    duration: [5, 15],
    instructions: 'Hold phone at arm\'s length, both actors face camera'
  },
  'Single Handheld': {
    tripodRequired: false,
    minActors: 1,
    maxActors: 1,
    cameraOperator: 'separate',
    complexity: 'low',
    duration: [10, 30],
    instructions: 'One person films, one person acts. Keep camera steady.'
  },
  'Two-Shot Handheld': {
    tripodRequired: false,
    minActors: 2,
    maxActors: 2,
    cameraOperator: 'actor',
    complexity: 'medium',
    duration: [15, 45],
    instructions: 'One actor holds camera at arm\'s length, both in frame'
  },
  'Group Static': {
    tripodRequired: true,
    minActors: 2,
    maxActors: 8,
    cameraOperator: 'none',
    complexity: 'medium',
    duration: [20, 60],
    instructions: 'Set tripod 6-8 feet away, all actors in frame, minimal movement'
  },
  'Moving Tracking': {
    tripodRequired: true,
    minActors: 1,
    maxActors: 4,
    cameraOperator: 'dedicated',
    complexity: 'high',
    duration: [15, 45],
    instructions: 'Camera operator follows subject movement smoothly'
  },
  'Complex Blocking': {
    tripodRequired: true,
    minActors: 3,
    maxActors: 8,
    cameraOperator: 'dedicated',
    complexity: 'high',
    duration: [30, 90],
    instructions: 'Multiple actors with coordinated movements and entrances'
  }
};
```

#### AI Prompt Engineering
```javascript
const generateStoryboardPrompt = (userPrompt, constraints) => {
  const availableShots = getValidShotTypes(constraints);
  const shotDescriptions = availableShots.map(shot => 
    `${shot.name}: ${shot.description} (${shot.instructions})`
  ).join('\n');

  return `
    Create a storyboard for this story: "${userPrompt}"
    
    CONSTRAINTS:
    - Available actors: ${constraints.actors}
    - Tripod available: ${constraints.hasTripod ? 'Yes' : 'No'}
    - Location: ${constraints.location || 'Indoor'}
    
    AVAILABLE SHOT TYPES:
    ${shotDescriptions}
    
    REQUIREMENTS:
    - Use ONLY the available shot types listed above
    - Create 3-7 shots total
    - Each shot should be 10-60 seconds
    - Include specific dialogue for each shot
    - Provide clear blocking instructions
    - Ensure narrative flow and continuity
    
    OUTPUT FORMAT:
    Shot 1: [Type] - "[Dialogue]" - [Blocking description]
    Shot 2: [Type] - "[Dialogue]" - [Blocking description]
    ...
  `;
};
```

### Adaptive Runtime System

#### Real-Time Constraint Validation
```javascript
const validateSceneConstraints = (storyboard, currentConstraints) => {
  const issues = [];
  
  storyboard.forEach((shot, index) => {
    const shotType = SHOT_FEASIBILITY[shot.type];
    
    // Actor count validation
    if (currentConstraints.actors < shotType.minActors) {
      issues.push({
        shot: index + 1,
        type: 'insufficient_actors',
        message: `Shot ${index + 1} requires ${shotType.minActors} actors, but only ${currentConstraints.actors} available`,
        suggestions: ['Add more actors', 'Change shot type', 'Remove this shot']
      });
    }
    
    // Equipment validation
    if (shotType.tripodRequired && !currentConstraints.hasTripod) {
      issues.push({
        shot: index + 1,
        type: 'missing_equipment',
        message: `Shot ${index + 1} requires a tripod`,
        suggestions: ['Get a tripod', 'Use handheld alternative', 'Skip this shot']
      });
    }
  });
  
  return issues;
};
```

#### Dynamic Regeneration
```javascript
const regenerateIncompatibleShots = async (storyboard, constraints) => {
  const issues = validateSceneConstraints(storyboard, constraints);
  const problematicShots = issues.map(issue => issue.shot - 1);
  
  if (problematicShots.length === 0) return storyboard;
  
  // Regenerate only the problematic shots
  const newShots = await Promise.all(
    problematicShots.map(index => 
      generateAlternativeShot(storyboard[index], constraints)
    )
  );
  
  // Replace problematic shots with new ones
  const updatedStoryboard = [...storyboard];
  problematicShots.forEach((shotIndex, i) => {
    updatedStoryboard[shotIndex] = newShots[i];
  });
  
  return updatedStoryboard;
};
```

#### In-App Purchase Integration
```javascript
import * as InAppPurchases from 'expo-in-app-purchases';

const PurchaseManager = {
  initialize: async () => {
    await InAppPurchases.connectAsync();
    await InAppPurchases.getProductsAsync(
      Object.values(CREDIT_PACKAGES).map(pkg => pkg.productId)
    );
  },
  
  purchaseCredits: async (packageName) => {
    const package = CREDIT_PACKAGES[packageName];
    try {
      const result = await InAppPurchases.purchaseItemAsync(package.productId);
      if (result.responseCode === InAppPurchases.IAPResponseCode.OK) {
        await this.addCreditsToAccount(package.credits);
        return { success: true, credits: package.credits };
      }
    } catch (error) {
      return { success: false, error: error.message };
    }
  },
  
  restorePurchases: async () => {
    const history = await InAppPurchases.getPurchaseHistoryAsync();
    // Process and restore valid purchases
  }
};
```

### Analytics and Monitoring

#### User Behavior Tracking
```javascript
import * as Analytics from 'expo-analytics-segment';

const trackUserEvent = (eventName, properties = {}) => {
  Analytics.track(eventName, {
    ...properties,
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    app_version: Constants.manifest.version,
    platform: Platform.OS
  });
};

// Key events to track
const TRACKED_EVENTS = {
  scene_created: 'Scene Created',
  shot_recorded: 'Shot Recorded',
  video_compiled: 'Video Compiled',
  scene_shared: 'Scene Shared',
  credit_purchased: 'Credit Purchased',
  feature_used: 'Feature Used'
};
```

#### Error Monitoring
```javascript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react-native';

// Initialize error tracking
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: __DEV__ ? 'development' : 'production'
});

// Custom error boundaries for critical features
const withErrorBoundary = (Component, fallbackComponent) => {
  return Sentry.withErrorBoundary(Component, fallbackComponent);
};
```
